MQ135 is an Air Quality Sensor suitable for detecting of NH3, Alcohol, Benzene
and other gases.
This library reads the voltage output from this sensor and transform it to
gas related physical measure.
The "sensitivity characteristics of the MQ-135" figure of the datasheet
it is used to convert the output from the sensor to the related ppm physical
charateristic for the gas under test.

Setup parameters can be found in file mq135.h
